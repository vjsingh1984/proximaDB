# ProximaDB OSS ships MECHANISM + NEUTRAL meters only. Commercial POLICY
# ($-pricing rates, $-ARR/revenue targets, $-budgets/salaries) lives in anvaiops
# — see docs/12-design/OSS_ENTERPRISE_BOUNDARY_2026_06_17.adoc. This lint BLOCKS
# accidental re-introduction of commercial $-content into the public docs.
#
# Catches: $-per-unit pricing ($0.50/hour, $100/DBU) + $-denominated amounts
# ($50M, $400K — covers ARR targets, budgets, salaries). Bare demo prices
# ($500 in a use-case example) are NOT matched (no K/M/B suffix, no /unit).
#
# ALLOWLISTED (legitimately use $ as DESIGN rationale — market-size context,
# cloud cost model, the boundary definition itself): the co-design mechanism
# docs. New policy $ there is caught by review, not this lint.
