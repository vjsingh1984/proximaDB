"""Block customer-facing docs from contradicting the support contract.

The authoritative support contract is docs/SUPPORTED_SURFACE.adoc. Narrative
docs must not present retired engines as live, miscount the supported engines,
or list experimental engines/transports without the experimental caveat. This
turns "do the docs match reality?" into a gate instead of a manual audit — it
would have caught the 11-file drift fixed in #547 at PR time.

Rules are declarative (regex + allow-list), not asciidoc-table parsing (brittle):

  1. Retired graph engines PULSAR/QUASAR may appear ONLY in allow-listed
     retirement/migration docs. Anywhere else is a violation (use ORION).
  2. Claims of 4/6 supported storage engines are wrong — SST is Supported;
     VIPER/HELIX/NOVA are Beta; SWIFT/RAPTOR are Experimental.
  3. SWIFT, RAPTOR, and Arrow Flight are experimental: any in-scope doc that
     mentions one of them must ALSO carry the word "experimental" (the
     off-by-default caveat). A doc listing them as supported without that caveat
     is a violation.
  4. pgwire is autocommit-only. Customer-facing docs may not claim that it
     supports multi-statement transactions or recommend it for transactional
     batches until the protocol conformance gate proves atomic rollback.

Exit 0 = clean, 1 = violation(s) found, 2 = usage error.
