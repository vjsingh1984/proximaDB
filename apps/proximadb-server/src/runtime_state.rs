//! The embedded process-lifecycle contract: one state file per data dir.
//!
//! ## Why this exists
//!
//! The boundary between a supervising client (the Python SDK's
//! `EmbeddedProximaDB`, a test harness, an IDE) and a spawned server carried
//! **no state in either direction**, which produced two failure modes that
//! look unrelated but share one cause:
//!
//! * **Startup was indistinguishable from death** (#1667). Listeners bind at
//!   the END of `ProximaDB::start` (recovery first), so during a long WAL
//!   replay there is no socket at all. A supervisor polling HTTP sees exactly
//!   what a crashed process looks like, so it applies a fixed timeout — 30 s
//!   in the SDK — and kills a healthy server that was minutes into a
//!   measured >180 s recovery of a 1.3 GB data dir, then silently fell back
//!   to another backend.
//! * **Ownership was unrecorded** (anvai-labs/victor#911). A server spawned
//!   with `setsid` outlives its parent, keeps writing its data dir, and is
//!   invisible to the next run — so "clear the data dir and re-index"
//!   silently resurrected old state, and orphans accumulated.
//!
//! Both are the same gap: *the lifecycle has no observable state and no
//! ownership record*. Per the co-design mandate, the fix belongs at the
//! boundary and must be a contract, not a heuristic — so this module defines
//! one, and both sides are tested against it.
//!
//! ## The contract
//!
//! While a server owns `<data_dir>`, it maintains `<data_dir>/.proximadb-runtime.json`:
//!
//! ```json
//! {"pid": 123, "phase": "recovering_storage", "started_at_ms": 1, "updated_at_ms": 2,
//!  "heartbeat_interval_ms": 2000, "config_path": "…", "version": "0.3.0"}
//! ```
//!
//! * **Written before any slow work** — a supervisor learns the pid and phase
//!   long before a socket exists.
//! * **Heartbeat advances** (`updated_at_ms`) on a fixed interval for the
//!   process lifetime. A supervisor therefore distinguishes *slow* (phase or
//!   heartbeat advancing) from *dead* (heartbeat stale, or pid gone) without
//!   any fixed assumption about how long recovery "should" take. This is the
//!   property that makes an unbounded operation safely supervisable.
//! * **Removed on clean exit**, so an absent file means "no owner".
//! * **Staleness is decidable**: [`RuntimeState::is_stale`] — pid no longer
//!   alive, or heartbeat older than a generous multiple of its interval.
//!
//! The file is advisory, not a lock: it never blocks the server from
//! starting. It exists so clients can make correct decisions instead of
//! guessing.
