**Proximity at Scale** +
_The cloud-native vector database engineered for AI applications_

A high-performance, enterprise-grade vector database built in Rust with intelligent storage tiering, distributed consensus, and comprehensive API support for modern AI workloads.

== Why ProximaDB?

The explosion of AI applications demands vector databases that can handle massive scale while maintaining sub-millisecond performance. Traditional solutions fall short in three critical areas:

**Performance Bottlenecks** üí•:: Existing vector databases struggle with high-throughput writes and concurrent reads, leading to application bottlenecks and poor user experiences.

**Cost Inefficiency** üí∏:: Memory-only solutions require expensive hardware scaling, while naive disk storage sacrifices performance. Smart tiering is essential but missing.

**AI Integration Gaps** üîó:: Most databases treat vectors as generic data, lacking native integration with AI frameworks, embedding models, and real-time inference pipelines.

ProximaDB solves these challenges with a cloud-native, serverless-first architecture designed specifically for AI workloads.

== What is ProximaDB?

ProximaDB is a **cloud-native vector database** that provides:

=== ‚ö° Core Capabilities
- **Sub-millisecond Search**: HNSW indexing with SIMD optimizations
- **High-Throughput Writes**: LSM tree architecture with WAL durability  
- **Intelligent Tiering**: 5-tier storage from ultra-hot (MMAP) to archive (Glacier)
- **Native AI Integration**: Built-in support for BERT, OpenAI, Cohere embeddings
- **Multi-Protocol APIs**: gRPC and REST with identical feature sets

=== üèóÔ∏è Architecture Highlights
- **AXIS Indexing**: Adaptive eXtensible Indexing System with ML-driven optimization
- **VIPER Storage**: Vector-optimized Parquet storage with compression
- **Serverless Ready**: Auto-scaling with scale-to-zero capabilities
- **Multi-Tenant**: Collection-based isolation with enterprise security

=== üåç Deployment Flexibility
- **Local Development**: Docker Compose for quick setup
- **Cloud Production**: Kubernetes with auto-scaling
- **Edge Computing**: Distributed deployment for low-latency access
- **Multi-Cloud**: S3, Azure Blob, GCS integration

== How ProximaDB Works

ProximaDB implements a **three-layer architecture** optimized for AI workloads:

=== 1. API Layer
**Unified Protocol Support**:: Single port serves both gRPC (HTTP/2 + Protobuf) and REST (HTTP/1.1 + JSON) with content-type detection
**Client SDKs**:: Python, JavaScript, Java with async support and retry logic
**Authentication**:: JWT, OAuth2, API keys with fine-grained permissions

=== 2. Compute Layer  
**Query Engine**:: Cost-based optimization with filter pushdown and quantized search
**Index Management**:: AXIS system with automatic strategy selection and zero-downtime migration
**Storage Engine**:: LSM trees with intelligent compaction and memory-mapped reads

=== 3. Storage Layer
**Intelligent Tiering**:: 
- Ultra-Hot (< 1ms): Memory-mapped files with OS page cache
- Hot (< 10ms): Local SSDs with LSM optimization  
- Warm (< 100ms): Local HDDs with compression
- Cold (< 1s): Object storage with Parquet analytics
- Archive (< 10s): Long-term retention with compliance

**Write-Ahead Log**:: Multi-format serialization (Avro, Bincode) with cloud-native batching and recovery optimization
