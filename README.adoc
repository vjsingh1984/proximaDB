=== Basic Usage

==== Python Client
[source,python]
----
from proximadb import ProximaDBClient

# Connect to server
client = ProximaDBClient("http://localhost:8080")

# Create collection with custom flush policy
collection = client.create_collection(
    name="embeddings",
    dimension=768,
    distance_metric="cosine",
    indexing_algorithm="hnsw",
    max_wal_age_hours=1.0,  # Flush every hour
    max_wal_size_mb=64.0    # Flush at 64MB
)

# Insert vectors with client-provided IDs
vectors = [
    {"id": "doc_1", "vector": [0.1, 0.2, 0.3], "metadata": {"type": "document"}},
    {"id": "doc_2", "vector": [0.4, 0.5, 0.6], "metadata": {"type": "image"}}
]
client.batch_insert("embeddings", vectors)

# Search vectors
results = client.search("embeddings", query_vector=[0.1, 0.2, 0.3], k=10)
----

==== REST API
[source,bash]
----
# Create collection
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/collections \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "embeddings",
    "dimension": 768,
    "distance_metric": "cosine",
    "max_wal_age_hours": 0.5,
    "max_wal_size_mb": 32
  }'

# Insert vector with client ID
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/collections/embeddings/vectors \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "id": "user_123",
    "vector": [0.1, 0.2, 0.3],
    "metadata": {"user": "alice"}
  }'

# Search vectors
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/collections/embeddings/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "vector": [0.1, 0.2, 0.3],
    "k": 10,

=== Tuning Guidelines
* Use `max_wal_age_hours: 0.1` (6 minutes) for real-time applications
* Set `max_wal_size_mb: 256` for high-throughput writes
* Enable `background_flush: true` for consistent performance
* Use HNSW with `m: 16, ef_construction: 200` for balanced accuracy/speed

    name="high_frequency",
    dimension=512,
    max_wal_age_hours=0.25,    # Flush every 15 minutes
    max_wal_size_mb=64,        # Smaller WAL size
    flush_priority=80          # High priority flushing
