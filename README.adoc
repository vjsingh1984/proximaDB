**Proximity at Scale** +
_The cloud-native vector database engineered for AI applications with intelligent multi-disk distribution_

A high-performance, enterprise-grade vector database built in Rust featuring multi-disk assignment service, intelligent storage distribution, and comprehensive API support for modern AI workloads.

== üéØ Why ProximaDB?

The explosion of AI applications demands vector databases that can handle scale while maintaining performance. ProximaDB addresses key challenges with its innovative multi-disk architecture:

**Multi-Disk Distribution** üíæ:: Intelligent assignment service distributes collections across multiple disks for optimal performance and fault tolerance.

**Cloud-Native Design** ‚òÅÔ∏è:: Multi-cloud filesystem abstraction supports file://, s3://, adls://, and gcs:// URLs with seamless integration.

**Enterprise Persistence** üîí:: Write-ahead logging with assignment-aware distribution ensures data durability and fast recovery.

**AI Integration** ü§ñ:: Native BERT embedding support tested with 384, 768, and 1024 dimensional vectors for state-of-the-art NLP applications.

== üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

ProximaDB implements a sophisticated multi-disk architecture with intelligent assignment service:

image::Assignment Service Flow.png[Assignment Service Flow,600,align=center]

=== ‚ö° Core Features

==== Multi-Disk Assignment Service
- **Round-Robin Distribution**: Fair collection distribution across configured disks
- **Collection Affinity**: Optional consistent collection-to-disk mapping
- **Discovery-Based Recovery**: Automatic assignment reconstruction during startup
- **Load Balancing**: Even distribution of write and read operations

==== Storage Architecture
- **VIPER Engine**: Vector-optimized Parquet storage with compression
- **Multi-Strategy WAL**: Avro and Bincode serialization with assignment integration
- **Filesystem Abstraction**: Unified interface for local and cloud storage
- **Atomic Operations**: Filesystem-level atomicity for data consistency

==== API Layer
- **Dual Protocol Support**: Simultaneous REST (5678) and gRPC (5679) servers
- **Zero-Copy Operations**: Avro binary serialization for large payloads
- **UUID Operations**: Support for both name and UUID-based collection access
- **Health Monitoring**: Assignment statistics and storage usage endpoints

== üöÄ Quick Start

=== Using Docker

[source,bash]
----
# Run with default configuration
docker run -p 5678:5678 -p 5679:5679 -v /data:/data proximadb/proximadb:latest

# Run with custom multi-disk configuration
docker run -p 5678:5678 -p 5679:5679 \
  -v /mnt/disk1:/data/disk1 \
  -v /mnt/disk2:/data/disk2 \
  -v /mnt/disk3:/data/disk3 \
  -v ./config.toml:/config.toml \
  proximadb/proximadb:latest --config /config.toml
----

=== Building from Source

[source,bash]
----
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/proximadb/proximadb.git
cd proximadb

# Build release version
cargo build --release

# Run with multi-disk configuration
cargo run --bin proximadb-server -- --config config.toml
----

=== Python SDK Example

[source,python]
----
from proximadb import ProximaDBClient
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

# Initialize client
client = ProximaDBClient("localhost:5678")  # Auto-detects REST protocol

# Create collection
collection = client.create_collection(
    name="documents",
    dimension=384,
    distance_metric="cosine"
)

# Generate BERT embeddings
model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
texts = ["ProximaDB scales with multi-disk architecture", 
         "Assignment service ensures optimal distribution"]
embeddings = [model.encode(text).tolist() for text in texts]

# Insert vectors
for i, (text, embedding) in enumerate(zip(texts, embeddings)):
    client.insert_vector(
        collection_id="documents",
        vector_id=f"doc_{i}",
        vector=embedding,
        metadata={"text": text}
    )

# Search similar vectors
query = "How does ProximaDB handle scaling?"
query_embedding = model.encode(query).tolist()

results = client.search(
    collection_id="documents",
    query_vector=query_embedding,
    k=5
)
----

== üìã Multi-Disk Configuration

ProximaDB's multi-disk architecture provides linear scalability and fault tolerance:

[source,toml]
----
[storage.wal_config]
wal_urls = [
    "file:///data/disk1/wal",
    "file:///data/disk2/wal", 
    "file:///data/disk3/wal"
]
distribution_strategy = "LoadBalanced"
collection_affinity = true
memory_flush_size_bytes = 1048576  # 1MB

[[storage.storage_layout.base_paths]]
base_dir = "/data/disk1/storage"
instance_id = 1
disk_type = { NvmeSsd = { max_iops = 100000 } }

[[storage.storage_layout.base_paths]]
base_dir = "/data/disk2/storage"
instance_id = 2
disk_type = { NvmeSsd = { max_iops = 100000 } }

[[storage.storage_layout.base_paths]]
base_dir = "/data/disk3/storage"
instance_id = 3
disk_type = { NvmeSsd = { max_iops = 100000 } }
----

== üìä Performance & Scalability

image::Data Flow and Persistence.png[Data Flow,600,align=center]

=== Multi-Disk Benefits

- **Parallel I/O Operations**: Concurrent reads/writes across multiple disks
- **Linear Scalability**: Performance scales with additional disks
- **Fault Tolerance**: Disk failure isolation with automatic recovery
- **Load Distribution**: Even collection distribution via round-robin assignment
