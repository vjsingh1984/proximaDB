**Proximity at Scale** +
_The cloud-native vector database engineered for AI applications_

A high-performance, enterprise-grade vector database built in Rust with intelligent storage tiering, distributed consensus, and comprehensive API support for modern AI workloads.

== Why ProximaDB?

The explosion of AI applications demands vector databases that can handle scale while maintaining performance. ProximaDB addresses key challenges:

**Flexible Storage** 💾:: VIPER engine with Parquet columnar format provides efficient vector storage with compression support.

**Cloud-Native Design** ☁️:: Multi-cloud filesystem abstraction supports file://, s3://, adls://, and gcs:// URLs for flexible deployment.

**AI Integration** 🤖:: Native BERT embedding support tested with 384, 768, and 1024 dimensional vectors.

ProximaDB solves these challenges with a cloud-native, serverless-first architecture designed specifically for AI workloads.

== What is ProximaDB?

ProximaDB is a **cloud-native vector database** that provides:

=== ⚡ Core Capabilities
- **Collection Management**: Full CRUD operations with metadata persistence
- **Vector Storage**: VIPER engine with Parquet-based columnar format  
- **WAL Durability**: Write-ahead logging with Avro/Bincode serialization
- **BERT Integration**: Tested support for common BERT model dimensions
- **Dual-Protocol APIs**: gRPC (port 5679) and REST (port 5678) with separate servers

=== 🏗️ Architecture Highlights
- **AXIS Indexing**: Adaptive indexing system (85% complete, integration pending)
- **VIPER Storage**: Vector-optimized Parquet storage engine (implemented)
- **Unified Services**: Consolidated architecture for all database operations
- **Atomic Operations**: Filesystem-level atomicity for data consistency

=== 🌍 Deployment Flexibility
- **Local Development**: Docker Compose for quick setup
- **Cloud Production**: Kubernetes with auto-scaling
- **Edge Computing**: Distributed deployment for low-latency access
- **Multi-Cloud**: S3, Azure Blob, GCS integration

== How ProximaDB Works

ProximaDB implements a **three-layer architecture** optimized for AI workloads:

=== 1. API Layer
**Multi-Server Protocol Support**:: Separate servers for gRPC (port 5679, HTTP/2 + Protobuf) and REST (port 5678, HTTP/1.1 + JSON)
**Client SDKs**:: Python, JavaScript, Java with async support and retry logic
**Authentication**:: JWT, OAuth2, API keys with fine-grained permissions

=== 2. Compute Layer  
**Query Engine**:: Cost-based optimization with filter pushdown and quantized search
**Index Management**:: AXIS system with automatic strategy selection and zero-downtime migration
**Storage Engine**:: LSM trees with intelligent compaction and memory-mapped reads

=== 3. Storage Layer
**Flexible Storage**:: 
- Memory-mapped files for fast access via OS page cache
- Parquet columnar format for efficient vector storage
- Multi-cloud support via filesystem URLs
- Atomic write strategies for data consistency

**Write-Ahead Log**:: Multi-format serialization (Avro, Bincode) with cloud-native batching and recovery optimization
