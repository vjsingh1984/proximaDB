note over AssignSvc
    **Assignment Strategies:**
    • Round-Robin: Fair distribution
    • Hash-Based: Consistent placement  
    • Performance-Based: Fastest disk first
    • Manual: Explicit configuration
end note

note over Discovery
    **Discovery Process:**
    • Scans all configured directories
    • Identifies existing collections
    • Records assignments for recovery
    • Supports multiple URL schemes
end note

note over RR
    **Round-Robin Logic:**
    counter = (counter + 1) % directories.length
    Ensures fair distribution across
    all configured storage directories
end note
