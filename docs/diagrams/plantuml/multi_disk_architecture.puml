note right of Assignment
  **Round-Robin Assignment Logic:**
  • Collection → Disk mapping
  • Fair distribution across disks
  • Affinity-based placement
  • Discovery on startup
end note

note bottom of BaseWAL
  **Base Trait Pattern:**
  • Consistent assignment logic
  • Polymorphic behavior
  • No code duplication
  • Extensible interface
end note

note bottom of Cloud
  **URL-Based Configuration:**
  file:///data/disk1/wal
  s3://bucket/proximadb/wal
  adls://account/container/wal
  gcs://bucket/proximadb/wal
