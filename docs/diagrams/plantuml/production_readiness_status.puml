' Status Legend
note right of CORE
  **Legend:**
  ✅ Production Ready
  🚧 In Development  
  ⚠️ Needs Attention
  ❌ Broken/Fixed
  🔧 Under Investigation
end note

' Critical Path
note right of SEARCH
  **Critical Issue:**
  Search interface working
  but zero vectors discovered.
  
  **Next Steps:**
  1. Investigate vector storage
  2. Verify WAL→VIPER flush
  3. Check collection metadata
  4. Validate search paths
end note

' Production Readiness Score
note bottom
  **Production Readiness: 75%**
  
  ✅ Ready: Infrastructure, Storage, Insertion
  🚧 In Progress: Indexing, Advanced Features  
  ❌ Critical: Search result discovery
  
  **Estimated Resolution: 1-2 days**
