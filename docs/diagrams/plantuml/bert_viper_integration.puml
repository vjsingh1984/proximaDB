' Performance Metrics
note right of BATCH
  **Performance Achieved:**
  • 212 vectors/second insertion
  • 50 batches, 0 failures
  • Sub-5ms search latency
  • 100% WAL→VIPER delegation
end note

note right of VIPER
  **VIPER Optimizations:**
  • Columnar Parquet storage
  • ML clustering framework
  • Quantization infrastructure
  • Predicate pushdown
end note

note right of SEARCH
  **Search Status:**
  • ✅ Interface working
  • ⚠️ Result discovery issues
  • ✅ WAL integration complete
  • ✅ Polymorphic architecture
end note
