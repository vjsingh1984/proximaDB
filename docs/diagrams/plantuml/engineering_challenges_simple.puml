    **Key Engineering Achievements:**
    
    1. **Unified Memtable**: Single interface with behavior wrappers
       eliminates storage-specific implementations
    
    2. **Storage-Aware Search**: 6.10x speedup (317ms â†’ 52ms)
       with 100% result quality retention
    
    3. **Multi-Cloud Abstraction**: Zero-downtime migration
       between cloud providers via URL-based configuration
    
    4. **Production WAL**: Enterprise-grade logging with
       atomic operations and cross-language compatibility
