# Storage-Aware Polymorphic Search System Design

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the design and implementation of a storage-aware polymorphic search system for ProximaDB that optimizes vector search operations based on the underlying storage layout (VIPER vs LSM) and leverages format-specific optimizations including predicate pushdown, bloom filters, and quantization strategies.

## Problem Statement

The current search implementation in UnifiedAvroService hardcodes the use of VIPER engine regardless of the collection's actual storage type. This results in:

1. **Inefficient LSM searches**: LSM collections should use memtable + SSTable scanning with bloom filters
2. **Missed optimization opportunities**: No predicate pushdown for Parquet, no bloom filter usage for LSM
3. **No quantization support**: Cannot leverage PQ4, binary quantization, or other compression schemes
4. **Poor scalability**: Single search path doesn't scale to different storage types

## Architecture Overview

### High-Level Design Principles

1. **Storage-Format Awareness**: Search algorithms must understand and optimize for the underlying storage format
2. **Polymorphic Dispatch**: Route search requests to storage-specific implementations
3. **Index Integration**: Deep integration with storage-specific indexing (bloom filters, roaring bitmaps, etc.)
4. **Quantization Support**: Support multiple precision levels (FP32, PQ4, binary)
5. **Performance First**: Prioritize performance optimizations specific to each storage type

### Core Components

![Storage-Aware Search Architecture](images/search-architecture-simple.png)

The architecture consists of four main layers:

1. **API Layer**: REST and gRPC endpoints for search requests
2. **Service Layer**: UnifiedAvroService for request routing and CollectionService for metadata
3. **Search Engine Layer**: Polymorphic search implementations per storage type
4. **Storage Layer**: Storage-specific optimizations and data structures

## Technical Architecture Details

### Search Engine Trait Design

```rust
pub trait StorageSearchEngine: Send + Sync {
    async fn search_vectors(
        &self,
        collection_id: &str,
        query_vector: &[f32],
        k: usize,
        filters: Option<&MetadataFilter>,
        search_hints: &SearchHints,
    ) -> Result<Vec<SearchResult>>;
    
    fn search_capabilities(&self) -> SearchCapabilities;
    fn engine_type(&self) -> StorageEngineType;
}
```

### VIPER Search Optimizations

**Predicate Pushdown:**
- Push metadata filters down to Parquet column scans
- Reduce data transfer from storage layer
- Leverage Parquet's native filtering

**Clustering Integration:**
- Use ML-driven cluster selection
- Reduce search space before vector operations
- Cache cluster metadata for repeated queries

**Quantization Support:**
- FP32: Full precision for accuracy-critical applications
- PQ4: Product quantization for balanced speed/accuracy
- Binary: Maximum speed for similarity-tolerant searches

### LSM Search Optimizations

**Tiered Search Strategy:**
1. Search active memtable (most recent data)
2. Search Level 0 SSTables (recent flushes)
3. Search higher levels based on key ranges
4. Merge results with tombstone handling

**Bloom Filter Integration:**
- Skip SSTables that definitely don't contain target vectors
- Reduce I/O for negative searches
- Configurable false positive rates

**Level-Aware Optimization:**
- Prioritize recent levels for temporal queries
- Use key range metadata to skip irrelevant SSTables
- Implement efficient merge strategies

## Performance Expectations

### VIPER Improvements
- **Predicate Pushdown**: 50-80% reduction in data scanned
- **Clustering**: 70-90% reduction in vector comparisons
- **Quantization (PQ4)**: 4x faster search with <5% accuracy loss
- **Overall**: 3-5x performance improvement

### LSM Improvements
- **Bloom Filters**: 90-95% reduction in false positive SSTable reads
- **Tiered Search**: 60-80% faster searches through prioritization
- **Tombstone Handling**: Correct results with minimal overhead
- **Overall**: 2-3x performance improvement
