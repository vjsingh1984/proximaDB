=== WAL Flush Coordination Architecture

image::diagrams/plantuml/WAL_Flush_Coordination_Simple.png[WAL Architecture,width=100%]

==== WAL Durability Strategy Configuration

ProximaDB provides comprehensive WAL configuration through `config.toml`:

```toml
[storage.wal_config]
# WAL durability and performance configuration
strategy_type = "Avro"  # Options: "Avro" (schema evolution), "Bincode" (performance)

# Memtable strategy - choose based on your sync_mode and workload:
# - "BTree": Best for PerBatch/Periodic sync (ordered flush, efficient storage)  
# - "SkipList": Best for Always sync (concurrent reads during slow disk writes)
# - "HashMap": Best for MemoryOnly sync (O(1) memory ops matter when no disk)
# - "Art": Best for sparse collections with heavy metadata filtering
memtable_type = "BTree"

# Durability vs Performance Tradeoff:
# - "Always": fsync() on every write (~1-10ms latency, maximum durability)
# - "PerBatch": fsync() after batch completion (balanced, recommended for production)
# - "Periodic": fsync() on timer (good for high throughput)
# - "Never": no fsync() (fastest, data loss risk on crash)
# - "MemoryOnly": no disk WAL, flush directly to storage files (fastest writes)
sync_mode = "PerBatch"
```

==== Optimal Configuration Guidelines

[cols="2,2,3"]
|===
|Sync Mode |Best Memtable |Use Case

|`Always`
|`SkipList`
|Maximum durability, concurrent reads during slow disk writes

|`PerBatch`
|`BTree`
|**Production default** - balanced performance with ordered flush

|`Periodic`
|`BTree`
|High throughput with periodic durability

|`MemoryOnly`
|`HashMap`
|Fastest writes, no disk WAL (flush to storage only)

|`Never`
|`HashMap`
|Maximum speed, data loss acceptable

=== Implementation Priority Summary

**Total Implementation Effort: 38-58 days**

1. **High Priority (7-8 days)**: Collection updates + vector filter deletion
2. **Medium Priority (6-8 days)**: Multi-search + atomic operations

**Implementation Order Recommendation:**
1. `update_collection()` - Quick win, high user value
2. `delete_vectors_by_filter()` - Common operation, moderate complexity
3. `multi_search()` - Performance optimization for power users
4. `atomic_insert_vectors()` - Data integrity improvement
5. `search_with_aggregations()` - Analytics enhancement
6. `get_vector_history()` - Advanced versioning feature
