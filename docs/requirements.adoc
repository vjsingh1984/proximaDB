== Abstract

ProximaDB is a cloud-native vector database engineered for AI-first applications. This document outlines comprehensive requirements for building a high-performance, scalable vector database with intelligent tiering, distributed consensus, and GPU acceleration capabilities for both vector operations and inference workloads.

=== Mission
Deliver a cloud-native vector database that provides:
- Sub-millisecond vector similarity search at internet scale
- Intelligent data tiering from ultra-hot to archive storage
- Seamless integration with AI inference frameworks
