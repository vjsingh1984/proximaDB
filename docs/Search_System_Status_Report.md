# ProximaDB Search System Status Report
**Date**: July 2, 2025  
**Status**: Critical Issue - Vector Discovery Debugging Phase  
**Priority**: High - Production Blocker  

## Executive Summary

ProximaDB has achieved significant infrastructure milestones with production-ready insertion performance (212 vectors/sec) and comprehensive BERT embedding integration. However, a critical search issue has been identified where the search interface works correctly but returns zero results despite successful vector insertion.

## ‚úÖ Achievements Completed

### Infrastructure & Performance
- **Dual-server architecture**: REST (5678) + gRPC (5679) operational
- **Insertion performance**: 212 vectors/second sustained throughput
- **BERT integration**: 10,000 768-dimensional vectors successfully tested
- **Batch processing**: 200-vector batches with 0% failure rate
- **WAL system**: Write-ahead logging with Avro/Bincode serialization

### Search Interface Fixes
- **gRPC client fixed**: Corrected `result_payload` oneof parsing
- **Protobuf compatibility**: Resolved `compact_results` vs `avro_results` handling
- **Error elimination**: No more "result_payload" parsing errors
- **Response handling**: Proper `WhichOneof('result_payload')` usage

### Search Architecture
- **Polymorphic search**: Factory pattern with storage-aware engines
- **WAL integration**: Unflushed vector search capability
- **VIPER engine**: Storage-aware search with optimization hints
- **LSM engine**: Memtable + SSTable search coordination

## ‚ùå Critical Issue: Vector Discovery

### Problem Description
```
- Search interface: ‚úÖ Working (no errors)
- gRPC communication: ‚úÖ Working (sub-5ms response)
- Vector insertion: ‚úÖ Working (212 vectors/sec)
- Search results: ‚ùå ZERO vectors found
- Collection status: ‚ö†Ô∏è vector_count = 0 despite insertion
```

### Investigation Status

#### Root Cause Hypotheses
1. **Storage delegation issue**: Vectors inserted to WAL but not discoverable
2. **Collection metadata**: Vector count not updating correctly
3. **Search path routing**: Polymorphic factory not finding correct engine
4. **VIPER flush status**: Vectors pending in WAL, not flushed to Parquet
5. **Index synchronization**: AXIS indexing not reflecting inserted vectors

#### Debugging Evidence
- **WAL search fixed**: `record.vector` field name corrected (was `record.dense_vector`)
- **Collection exists**: `bert_viper_10k` collection properly created
- **Insertion success**: Server reports successful batch processing
- **Search routing**: Polymorphic factory correctly identifies VIPER engine
- **Response format**: gRPC responses properly formatted

## üîß Next Actions Required

### Immediate Priority (1-2 days)
1. **Vector storage verification**: Check if vectors are actually persisted
2. **WAL‚ÜíVIPER flush status**: Verify flush delegation working
3. **Collection metadata sync**: Ensure vector_count reflects insertions
4. **Search path debugging**: Trace polymorphic search execution

### Investigation Plan
```bash
1. Check WAL contents directly
2. Verify VIPER Parquet file generation
3. Test immediate post-insertion search
4. Validate collection service vector count updates
5. Debug polymorphic search routing
```
