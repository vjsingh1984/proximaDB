# ProximaDB Feature Toggles

**Version**: 0.2.0  
**Last Updated**: 2026-05-01  
**Purpose**: Document all feature flags, their purposes, and production readiness criteria

## Overview

ProximaDB uses feature flags to control compilation of different components, optimize binary size, and separate stable from experimental functionality. This document provides a comprehensive reference for all available feature flags.

## Feature Flag Categories

### 1. Default Features (Always On)

These features are enabled by default and represent the core ProximaDB functionality:

- **`sql_frontend`** - SQL query parsing and execution engine
- **`graph-first-sks`** - Graph-first architecture with ORION-backed entity store
- **`unified-facade-routing`** - Unified query facade for consistent execution

**Production Status**: ✅ Production Ready  
**Test Coverage**: 80%+  
**Backward Compatibility**: Guaranteed

### 2. Optional Surfaces

These features control optional API surfaces and are kept off by default to minimize binary size:

- **`ai_endpoints`** - AI-specific endpoints and operations
- **`sales_endpoints`** - Sales analytics and reporting endpoints  
- **`tenant_access`** - Multi-tenant access control
- **`executive_intel`** - Executive dashboard and intelligence features

**Production Status**: ⚠️ Beta  
**Test Coverage**: 60-70%  
**Backward Compatibility**: Best effort, may change between releases

**How to Enable**:
```bash
cargo build --features ai_endpoints,sales_endpoints
```

### 3. Experimental Features

⚠️ **WARNING**: Experimental features are incomplete and may cause panics or data loss.

- **`experimental-engines`** - SWIFT and RAPTOR storage engines (archived research engines)
- **`distributed-graph`** - PULSAR distributed graph engine (cross-shard traversal incomplete)
- **`tiered-graph`** - QUASAR hybrid vector+graph engine (tiered storage incomplete)
- **`simd-experimental`** - Experimental SIMD optimizations (unstable)

## Production Readiness Criteria

Features must meet the following criteria to be considered "Production Ready":

1. **Test Coverage**: ≥80% for core features, ≥70% for optional features
2. **Performance**: Meets performance benchmarks documented in docs/SUPPORTED_SURFACE.adoc
3. **Security**: Passes security audit for relevant components
4. **Documentation**: Complete API documentation and usage examples
5. **Backward Compatibility**: Clear migration path for breaking changes
6. **Stability**: No unresolved critical bugs or known panics
7. **Operational Readiness**: Monitoring, logging, and debugging support

## Feature Maturity Levels

- **Alpha**: Experimental, breaking changes likely, limited testing
- **Beta**: Feature complete, limited production use, backward compatibility best effort
- **Production Ready**: Extensively tested, backward compatibility guaranteed, fully documented

## Feature Development Lifecycle

1. **Experimental** → Initial development, may be incomplete or unstable
2. **Beta** → Feature complete, testing in progress, limited production use
3. **Production Ready** → Meets all production readiness criteria
4. **Deprecated** → Superseded by better alternatives, will be removed
5. **Archived** → Removed from active development, moved to archive/

## Feature Flag Combinations

### Recommended Combinations

**Development/Testing**:
```bash
cargo build --features sql_frontend,graph-first-sks,unified-facade-routing
```

**Production Single-Node**:
```bash
cargo build --features python,network-rest,cdc-kafka
```

**Production Cluster**:
```bash
cargo build --features cluster,cloud-full,network-rest
```

**Full Enterprise**:
```bash
cargo build --features cluster,enterprise-catalogs,network-rest,cdc-kafka,python
```

**Experimental Development**:
```bash
cargo build --features experimental-engines,distributed-graph,tiered-graph
```

### Incompatible Combinations

- `experimental-engines` + `cluster` - Experimental engines not cluster-aware
- `standalone` + `cluster` - Mutually exclusive deployment modes
- `avx512` + stable Rust - Requires nightly compiler

## Feature-Specific Notes

### Python/PyO3 Features

The `python` feature enables Python bindings but does NOT change the crate-type. To build a Python shared library (cdylib), also enable the `pylib` feature:

```bash
# Python bindings with rlib (default, for testing)
cargo build --features python

# Python bindings with cdylib (for PyO3 shared library)
cargo build --features python,pylib
```

### Graph Engine Features

**ORION** (default, recommended):
- Always available, no feature flag needed
- Production-ready, most mature (253+ tests)
- In-memory CSR format with WAL persistence

**PULSAR** (distributed):
- Enable with `distributed-graph` feature
- ⚠️ Experimental: cross-shard traversal incomplete, no distributed WAL
- Recommendation: Use ORION with application-level sharding instead

**QUASAR** (tiered storage):
- Enable with `tiered-graph` feature  
- ⚠️ Experimental: no WAL for cold tier, simple LRU tiering
- Recommendation: Use ORION with appropriate memory sizing instead

### CDC Connector Features

**Kafka Integration**:
- Enable with `cdc-kafka` feature
- Production-ready, comprehensive Kafka producer/consumer support

**Native CDC Connectors** (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB):
- Enable with `experimental-cdc-connectors` feature
- ⚠️ Experimental: partial implementations without full network I/O
- Recommendation: Use Debezium with Kafka sink for production MySQL/MongoDB CDC

## Debugging Feature Flags

### Verbose Feature Compilation

To see which features are being compiled:

```bash
cargo build --features python,cluster 2>&1 | grep "cargo:rust-cdylib"
```

### Feature Dependency Resolution

To see feature dependencies:

```bash
cargo tree --features python,pylib
```

### Feature-Specific Unit Tests

To run tests for specific features:

```bash
# Test only Python bindings
cargo test --features python --lib

# Test cluster features
cargo test --features cluster --lib

# Test with experimental features
cargo test --features experimental-engines --lib
```

## Migration Guide

### Upgrading Feature Flags

When feature flags change between versions:

1. **Review** this document for changes in the release notes
2. **Update** build scripts to use new feature flag combinations
3. **Test** with new features before deploying to production
4. **Monitor** for deprecation warnings in build output

### Deprecated Features

Deprecated features will emit warnings during compilation:

```
warning: The 'experimental-engines' feature is deprecated and will be removed in v0.3.0
```

Action required before next upgrade.
