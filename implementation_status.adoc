== üèóÔ∏è Recent Major Accomplishments

=== Client ID Flow Alignment (June 2025)
* *Unified ID System*: Changed `VectorId` from UUID to String across entire stack
* *API Consistency*: REST and gRPC APIs now handle client-provided IDs identically
* *WAL Integration*: entry_id now uses vector_id instead of generating separate UUIDs
* *Storage Alignment*: All storage layers (LSM, index, search) use String IDs
* *Backward Compatibility*: Maintains API compatibility while improving flexibility

=== WAL System Overhaul
* *Strategy Pattern*: Pluggable WAL strategies (Avro, Bincode)
* *Collection Isolation*: Atomic flush operations per collection
* *Age Monitoring*: Background service for age-based flush triggers
* *Memory Tables*: Multiple memtable implementations with isolation
