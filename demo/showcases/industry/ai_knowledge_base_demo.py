Test Result: SKIP - Requires demo server with embedding/LLM services

AI Knowledge Base Demo for ProximaDB

An intelligent knowledge base system that combines ProximaDB's vector search with
LLM-powered responses. This demo showcases how to build production-ready AI applications
with semantic search, document understanding, and natural language Q&A.

Features:
- Document ingestion with intelligent chunking
- Semantic search using BERT embeddings
- LLM-powered answer generation (Flan-T5)
- High-performance gRPC protocol
- Interactive Q&A interface

Requirements:
- ProximaDB server running (localhost:5678)
- Demo server with embedding/LLM services (localhost:8080)

NOTE: This demo requires a separate demo server that provides:
  - /api/embeddings/chunk endpoint
  - /api/embeddings/embed endpoint
  - /api/embeddings/info endpoint
  - LLM service for answer generation

For basic RAG functionality without the demo server, see:
  demo/quickstart/basic_demo.py (shows vector insertion/search)

Usage:
    # Start demo server first (if available)
    docker compose up -d

    # Then run demo
    python ai_knowledge_base_demo.py

Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on developing computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

Types of Machine Learning:

1. Supervised Learning: The algorithm learns from labeled training data, helping predict outcomes for unforeseen data. Common algorithms include Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines.

2. Unsupervised Learning: The algorithm finds hidden patterns in unlabeled data. It includes clustering (K-means, DBSCAN) and dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE).

3. Reinforcement Learning: The algorithm learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize cumulative reward. Applications include game playing, robotics, and autonomous vehicles.

Key Concepts:
- Feature Engineering: The process of selecting and transforming variables for your model
- Cross-Validation: A technique to assess model performance on unseen data
- Overfitting: When a model performs well on training data but poorly on new data
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing the configuration settings of algorithms

Machine learning powers many modern applications including recommendation systems, fraud detection, natural language processing, and computer vision.

Vector Databases: The Foundation of AI Applications

Vector databases are specialized systems designed to store, index, and query high-dimensional vector embeddings. They have become essential infrastructure for modern AI applications, particularly those involving semantic search, recommendation systems, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

Why Vector Databases Matter:

Traditional databases excel at exact matches and structured queries but struggle with semantic similarity. Vector databases solve this by:
- Converting data into mathematical representations (embeddings)
- Enabling similarity search based on meaning rather than keywords
- Supporting real-time updates and queries at scale

Key Features:
1. Distance Metrics: Support for various similarity measures (cosine, euclidean, dot product)
2. Indexing Algorithms: HNSW, IVF, LSH for efficient nearest neighbor search
3. Scalability: Handling billions of vectors with sub-second query times
4. Integration: APIs for popular ML frameworks and embedding models

Use Cases:
- Semantic Search: Finding relevant documents based on meaning
- Recommendation Systems: Suggesting similar items based on user preferences
- RAG Systems: Enhancing LLMs with external knowledge
- Image/Video Search: Finding visually similar content
- Anomaly Detection: Identifying outliers in high-dimensional data

Popular vector databases include ProximaDB, Pinecone, Weaviate, Qdrant, and Milvus. Each offers unique features for different use cases and scale requirements.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Architecture

RAG combines the power of large language models with external knowledge retrieval to provide accurate, up-to-date, and verifiable responses. This architecture has become the standard for building AI systems that need access to specific domain knowledge.

Core Components:

1. Document Processing Pipeline:
   - Ingestion: Loading documents from various sources
   - Chunking: Breaking documents into optimal-sized segments
   - Embedding: Converting chunks into vector representations
   - Storage: Storing vectors and metadata in a vector database

2. Retrieval System:
   - Query Processing: Converting user questions to embeddings
   - Similarity Search: Finding relevant document chunks
   - Ranking: Ordering results by relevance
   - Context Assembly: Combining retrieved chunks

3. Generation Layer:
   - Prompt Engineering: Crafting effective prompts with context
   - LLM Integration: Using models like GPT, Claude, or Llama
   - Response Generation: Creating answers based on retrieved context
   - Citation Management: Linking responses to source documents

Best Practices:
- Chunk Size: Balance between context and relevance (typically 200-1000 tokens)
- Overlap: Include overlap between chunks to preserve context
- Metadata: Store source, timestamp, and other relevant information
- Hybrid Search: Combine vector similarity with keyword matching
- Evaluation: Measure retrieval quality and generation accuracy

Common Challenges and Solutions:
- Hallucination: Mitigated by grounding responses in retrieved documents
- Context Limits: Solved by intelligent chunk selection and summarization
- Update Frequency: Addressed with incremental indexing strategies
- Query Understanding: Enhanced with query expansion and reformulation

Understanding Embeddings: The Bridge Between Text and Vectors

Embeddings are dense vector representations of data that capture semantic meaning in a mathematical format. They serve as the foundation for modern NLP applications and vector search systems.

What Are Embeddings?

Embeddings transform discrete data (words, sentences, documents) into continuous vector spaces where:
- Similar items are close together
- Dissimilar items are far apart
- Mathematical operations preserve semantic relationships

Popular Embedding Models:

1. BERT-based Models:
   - all-MiniLM-L6-v2: Fast, 384 dimensions, good for general use
   - all-mpnet-base-v2: Higher quality, 768 dimensions
   - Specialized models for specific domains (legal, medical, scientific)

2. OpenAI Embeddings:
   - text-embedding-3-small: Cost-effective, 1536 dimensions
   - text-embedding-3-large: High quality, 3072 dimensions

3. Open Source Alternatives:
   - Sentence-BERT variants
   - Instructor embeddings
   - E5 models from Microsoft

Key Considerations:

Dimensionality: Higher dimensions capture more information but require more storage and computation. Common dimensions range from 384 to 4096.

Distance Metrics:
- Cosine Similarity: Best for normalized embeddings, measures angle
- Euclidean Distance: Measures straight-line distance, sensitive to magnitude
- Dot Product: Fast computation, works well with certain models

Quality Factors:
- Training Data: Models trained on diverse, high-quality data perform better
- Fine-tuning: Domain-specific fine-tuning improves performance
- Context Window: Longer context allows better understanding

Practical Tips:
- Normalize embeddings for consistent similarity scores
- Batch processing for efficiency
- Cache embeddings to avoid recomputation
- Monitor embedding drift over time
- Test different models for your specific use case
