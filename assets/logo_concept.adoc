== Logo Philosophy

The ProximaDB logo embodies four core concepts:

1. **Database** - Represented by the cylinder shape
2. **Vectors** - Shown as interconnected neural network nodes
3. **AI** - Lightning bolt symbolizing intelligence and speed
4. **Cloud** - Cloud shape encompassing the database

== Design Elements

=== Primary Logo (`logo_design.svg`)

* **Cloud Container**: Light gradient cloud shape representing cloud-native architecture
* **Database Cylinder**: Purple cylinder nested within the cloud showing data storage
* **Neural Network**: Green nodes with connections representing vector embeddings
* **AI Spark**: Yellow lightning bolt indicating AI-powered capabilities
* **Typography**: "Proxima" in gradient, "DB" in solid, emphasizing the AI/vector aspect

=== Minimal Logo (`logo_minimal.svg`)

* **Stylized "P"**: Forms both a letter and a database shape
* **Vector Nodes**: Three connected points creating a neural pattern
* **Gradient Colors**: Purple to blue transition suggesting innovation
* **Cloud Element**: Subtle cloud shape integrated into the design
* **Data Points**: Floating dots representing distributed data
