//! Advanced indexing algorithms for ProximaDB
//!
//! This module provides implementations of various vector indexing algorithms:
//! - IVF (Inverted File Index) for large-scale search
//! - LSH (Locality Sensitive Hashing) for binary vectors
//! - Disk-based indexing for massive datasets

// TODO: Implement IVF, LSH, and other advanced indexing algorithms
// For now, this module serves as a placeholder for future implementations
