        //
        // The previous implementation had TWO SEPARATE GraphCollectionService instances:
        // 1. One created by UnifiedHandlers::new() for REST/gRPC graph collection endpoints
        // 2. One created by GraphOperationsService::new() for node/edge operations
        //
        // This caused graph collections created via REST API to be INVISIBLE to graph
        // operations because they were stored in different instances.
        //
        // SOLUTION:
        //
        // Create a SINGLE GraphCollectionService instance here and pass it to BOTH:
        // - GraphOperationsService (via new_with_collection_service)
        // - UnifiedHandlers and query orchestration layers (via extracted graph contracts)
        //
        // This ensures ALL graph endpoints and operations share the same state.
