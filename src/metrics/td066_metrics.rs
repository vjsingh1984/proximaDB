//! TD-066 canonical-WAL-authority observability metrics (Option E of the
//! TD-066 (c) Part 2 LSN-correlation design,
//! `docs/12-design/TD_066_PART2_LSN_CORRELATION_DESIGN_2026_05_28.adoc`).
//!
//! Today's commits (`b36a24b17` emission + `4ece74250` production wiring +
//! `18c846ae8` recovery read-side observability) make the canonical WAL
//! durably carry `CanonicalOperation::Checkpoint(SnapshotManifest)`
//! entries and let ORION recovery scan them. Recovery BEHAVIOR is
//! unchanged in Part 1; these metrics expose **whether the wiring is
//! healthy** so operators can detect three failure modes without
//! touching the durability path:
//!
//! 1. `orion_recovery_canonical_checkpoint_age_seconds` — wall-clock
//!    age (seconds since `timestamp_ms` on the manifest) of the latest
//!    Checkpoint for the graph being recovered. High values indicate
//!    either flush_wal isn't being called often enough OR the canonical
//!    WAL isn't being persisted (production wiring bug). Reported on
//!    every `OrionGraphEngine::recover` call.
//!
//! 2. `orion_recovery_canonical_checkpoint_present_total` — count of
//!    recoveries where a canonical checkpoint was found for the graph.
//!    Pair with `..._absent_total` below to compute a hit ratio across
//!    deployment rollouts.
//!
//! 3. `orion_recovery_canonical_checkpoint_absent_total` — count of
//!    recoveries where NO canonical checkpoint was found. Expected on
//!    fresh deployments and pre-wired (legacy) configurations; should
//!    drop to zero once production wiring is fully rolled out.
//!
//! Labels are kept low-cardinality (`graph_id`) — same cardinality
//! profile as the other graph metrics.
