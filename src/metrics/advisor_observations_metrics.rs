//! Prometheus metrics for the ANN-advisor observability layer
//! (P4). Captures the gap between **predicted** recall / per-query
//! work (from the closed-form advisor formulas) and **observed**
//! recall / latency from real query traffic.
//!
//! # Why
//!
//! The advisor's constants (`A(m)`, `ceiling(m)`, `beta`,
//! `recall_factor`, `ceiling_of_n` for IVF) were calibrated
//! against in-repo sweeps at single anchor points
//! (HNSW: N=100K dim=128 cosine; IVF: same plus per-N sweep).
//! Real workloads vary across dim / distance / data distribution
//! in ways the static formulas don't capture.
//!
//! P4 captures the residuals **but does not feed them back to the
//! advisor**. The residual histogram + counter let an operator see
//! how accurate the advisor is per-collection / per-algorithm, and
//! provide the dataset a future RL bridge (P5+) will fit against.
//!
//! # Metrics shape
//!
//! Three surfaces, all labelled by `(collection, algorithm)`:
//!
//! * `axis_advisor_observations_total{collection, algorithm}` —
//!   counter, every search that captured an observation.
//! * `axis_advisor_recall_residual{collection, algorithm}` —
//!   histogram of `(observed_recall - advisor_predicted_recall)`.
//!   Only updated when `observed_recall` is populated (i.e. when
//!   the collection's `recall_probe` gate is active). Negative
//!   values mean the advisor over-promised; positive mean it
//!   under-promised.
//! * `axis_advisor_latency_us{collection, algorithm}` — histogram
//!   of observed per-query latency in microseconds. Always
//!   populated — the latency timing is universal, doesn't depend
//!   on recall_probe.
//!
//! # Cardinality
//!
//! `collection` is high-cardinality (one series per collection);
//! `algorithm` is bounded to 3 values today (hnsw / ivf / hmgi).
//! Deployments with >10K collections should consider a Prometheus
//! relabelling rule that drops the collection label before
//! ingestion, or move to per-collection rollup at scrape time.
