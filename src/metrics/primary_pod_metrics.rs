//! Primary-pod gateway write-router metrics
//!
//! Operator observability for the Slice 4 write-routing gate. Every
//! incoming write decision lands here so operators can answer:
//!
//! * **Are tenants being misrouted?** Spike in
//!   `proximadb_primary_pod_writes_misrouted_total` means clients are
//!   hitting the wrong pod — usually a stale routing table or a
//!   recent reassignment that hasn't propagated.
//! * **Is the gate ever firing?** Steady stream on
//!   `proximadb_primary_pod_writes_allowed_total{outcome="bound"}`
//!   means bindings are present and active. Zero traffic on that
//!   label means no tenants are bound (legacy / unbounded mode).
//! * **Per-tenant binding rate?** Use the `tenant_id` label.
//!
//! Labels are intentionally low-cardinality: 3 outcomes × tenant_id.
