//! ADR-069 / TD-WAL-1 — the live auto-flush DRIVER.
//!
//! The foundation PR (#1117) landed the flush *decision* (`flush_policy`) and the
//! *observability* (`wal_flush_metrics`) but deliberately shipped no trigger,
//! because the live canonical WAL path has no flush driver. This is that driver.
//!
//! It is a policy-gated, timer-driven clone of
//! [`crate::storage::engine::StorageEngine::flush_memtable_to_storage`]: each tick
//! it enumerates collections with unflushed data in the GLOBAL write buffer (the
//! same singleton REST/gRPC ingest writes to), evaluates the [`FlushPolicy`] per
//! collection (size / time / capacity envelope), and for those that are due calls
//! the proven [`materialize_collection`] recipe with `free_wal=true` — writing an
//! L0 SST and freeing the covered WAL. Every decision + flush is metered through
//! [`wal_flush_metrics`], so `/metrics/prometheus` shows exactly what fired.
//!
//! Durability is unaffected: the WAL fsync on write (SyncMode=PerBatch) is the
//! durability primitive; this driver only controls WHEN the memtable is
//! materialized to SST (RTO / WAL reclamation / object-store coalescing, plus the
//! volume-loss RPO bound). `free_wal=true` is the same setting the shutdown path
//! uses (de-risked by TD-165 cold-read recall); the live insert→flush→search
//! round-trip is the acceptance check.
//!
//! Spawned once from `StorageEngine::start()` when a periodic trigger is armed
//! (`policy.needs_scheduler()` — time or capacity budget set). The default config arms
//! the 300s time floor (ADR-069 D2 RPO safety net), so the driver spawns by default;
//! a config setting both `flush_interval_secs = 0` and `wal_max_bytes = 0` opts out.
