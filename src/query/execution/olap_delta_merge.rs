//! OLAP read-time delta merge (ADR-025, relational cold path).
//!
//! `ALTER TABLE … MATERIALIZE` writes an atomic, already-dead-filtered Parquet
//! snapshot of a table at a point in time (`snapshot_lsn`). Any `DELETE` /
//! `UPDATE` / `INSERT` that lands **after** that snapshot stays in the
//! authoritative record store (memtable + canonical WAL + PAX) and is *not*
//! reflected in the cold Parquet base. Without reconciliation an OLAP `SELECT`
//! routed to DataFusion over the Parquet base returns stale rows — the gap this
//! module closes.
//!
//! The reconciliation is a **read-time merge** keyed by the canonical `oid`:
//!
//! * `suppress` — the set of oids that changed since `snapshot_lsn`, taken from
//!   the canonical-WAL change-feed (`TableRecordStore::read_changes_since`).
//!   Deletes, updates, and post-snapshot inserts all land here.
//! * `appends` — the **current live** row for each changed oid, read back from
//!   the record store (already dead-record-filtered). A deleted/expired oid has
//!   no live row, so it simply does not appear in `appends`.
//!
//! The merged result is every base row whose oid is **not** suppressed and which
//! is not itself TTL-dead, followed by the appends. This is the in-memory
//! deletion vector of ADR-025 done WAL-first: the suppress-set is, by
//! construction, a rebuildable projection of the canonical WAL (ADR-020 — never a
//! parallel durable authority), and re-`MATERIALIZE` plays the role of the N3
//! compaction that physically drops the dead rows.
//!
//! This module is the pure, I/O-free core (so it unit-tests without the
//! `datafusion-integration` feature). The Arrow/Parquet wiring that feeds it the
//! base rows, suppress-set, and append rows lives in
//! [`crate::query::execution::datafusion_engine`].
