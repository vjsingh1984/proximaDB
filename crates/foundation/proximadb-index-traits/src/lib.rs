//! Storage↔Index (AXIS) decoupling contract — segregated role traits (ISP) plus a
//! slim, storage-facing query DTO that resolves the "query-envelope crux" from
//! `docs/12-design/STORAGE_INDEX_COMPUTE_DECOUPLING_CONTRACTS_2026_06_21.adoc`.
//!
//! # Why this crate exists
//!
//! `src/storage` reaches the AXIS index through the concrete `AxisManager`, but a
//! read-only survey (against `develop`) showed storage actually touches it through
//! only a handful of methods — and the rich query envelope
//! (`AxisHybridQuery`/`AxisManagerQueryResult`) drags in `proximadb_catalog`,
//! `core::search`, and `observability` types that cannot live in a foundation crate.
//!
//! The resolution (contract doc §A2, option 1 — the preferred one) is a **slim
//! storage-facing DTO**: define exactly what storage passes/reads, and convert
//! to/from the rich envelope *at the index boundary* (in the root crate, where
//! `AxisManager` lives). This keeps the trait crate dependency-light and lets it
//! sit in the foundation layer.
//!
//! Measured facts that shaped the DTO (all verified against the storage call sites):
//! * storage sets only `collection_id`, `vector_query`, `metadata_filters`,
//!   `id_filters`, `top_k`, `include_expired`, and `search_effort` on the query;
//!   it never sets `ann_filtering_policy`, `estimated_selectivity`, or
//!   `ann_filtering_mode` (all defaulted at the boundary), so the DTO omits them;
//! * storage reads only `results` from the query result — the observability fields
//!   (`strategy_used`, `predicate_shortfall`, `selected_filtering_mode`,
//!   `quantized_route`) are consumed by the service layer, which calls
//!   `AxisManager` directly, so the result DTO omits them.
//!
//! # Depend on the role, not the god-object (ISP + DIP)
//!
//! Engines should hold `Arc<dyn IndexQuery>` (etc.) injected at construction; the
//! concrete `AxisManager` is one implementor. This crate only defines the
//! abstractions and the boundary DTO — the implementations and conversions live in
//! the root crate next to `AxisManager`, and the per-engine field narrowing
//! (`Arc<AxisManager>` → `Arc<dyn IndexQuery>`) is a separate, coordinated step.
