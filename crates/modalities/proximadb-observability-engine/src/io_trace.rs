//! Per-query I/O trace bus (C0 — co-design trace substrate)
//!
//! This is the foundational deliverable of the co-design mandate
//! (`docs/12-design/CODESIGN_DIMENSIONAL_ARCHITECTURE_2026_06_19.adoc`, §4.1):
//! *you cannot co-design against a trace distribution you do not capture.*
//!
//! The existing `consumption_metrics` counters meter four per-tenant
//! **aggregates** (object-store ops, storage byte-seconds, task time, cache
//! stats) — excellent for billing, but they cannot answer the questions
//! co-design actually asks: *for this one query, how many GETs did we pay, how
//! many bytes did we move, did the footer cache hit, and which engine burned
//! the compute?* Those are the quantities the `ComputeScheduler` cost model
//! (§3 of the spec) must minimize, and they are per-query, not per-tenant.
//!
//! `IoTrace` captures them. It is bound to the request future as a
//! [`tokio::task_local!`] — exactly like
//! [`crate::predicate_diagnostics`] — so any depth of the
//! storage/engine call stack can record into it without threading a new
//! parameter through dozens of signatures (the dominant cost of doing this any
//! other way). At the request boundary the handler wraps the query in
//! [`instrument`] (or [`scope`]); downstream I/O sites call the free
//! [`record_op`] / [`record_bytes_read`] / [`record_footer`] helpers, which
//! **silently no-op outside an active scope** (so direct service/test callers
//! keep working and the Prometheus counters remain the operator-visible signal).
//!
//! On completion the snapshot is emitted as a structured `tracing` event under
//! the [`TARGET`] target. Once OpenTelemetry export is wired (§4.4) these
//! events become spans on the trace backend; today they are already
//! grep-able structured logs. This module adds **no new billing authority** —
//! the per-tenant counters stay the source of truth for chargeback; this is the
//! finer, per-query *source* the spec calls for.
//!
//! ## OpenTelemetry export (§4.4 — dependency-gated follow-up)
//!
//! Today the snapshot is emitted as a structured [`tracing`] event under
//! [`TARGET`] and is routable by any subscriber layer. Full export to an OTLP
//! collector (so these become persisted, queryable spans on a trace backend) is
//! a deliberate **dependency decision** not yet taken: the tree has
//! `tracing-subscriber` + `tracing-appender` but none of `opentelemetry`,
//! `opentelemetry_sdk`, `opentelemetry-otlp`, or `tracing-opentelemetry`. When
//! that stack is approved the wiring is small and already enabled here:
//!
//! 1. [`IoTraceSnapshot`] is `serde`-serializable, so it maps directly to OTLP
//!    span attributes (or a JSON sink) with no further plumbing.
//! 2. Attach a `tracing_opentelemetry::layer()` to the subscriber registry in
//!    `src/bin/server.rs` (beside the existing console/file `fmt` layers, at the
//!    `tracing_subscriber::registry()` call), gated on `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`.
//! 3. Point the existing `crate::monitoring::opentelemetry` config's
//!    `otlp_endpoint` at the collector.
//!
//! Until then, persistence is available with zero new deps by routing [`TARGET`]
//! to a `tracing-appender` JSON file sink.
