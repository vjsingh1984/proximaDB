//! Dependency-inversion port traits for ProximaDB storage (Slice D).
//!
//! Storage is high-level policy (engines, compaction, flush) that *drives*
//! higher-level collaborators (collection metadata, the ANN index). To let
//! `src/storage` depend *down* instead of *up* into `crate::services` /
//! `crate::index`, those collaborators are expressed here as narrow traits.
//! The concrete implementors (e.g. `CollectionService`) `impl` these traits in
//! their own modules, and the composition root injects `Arc<dyn …Port>` into
//! storage at startup. No upward edge anywhere.
//!
//! This crate is trait-only: no behavior, no concrete types beyond the stable
//! foundation proto types the contracts unavoidably name.
