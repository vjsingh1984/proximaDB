## Recommended Focus for SEC Filings Use Case

For XBRL and SEC filings with HTML/text content:

1. **Start with Document Schema** - More flexible for unstructured financial data
2. **Implement text tokenization** - For regulatory text search
3. **Add metadata indexing** - For company, filing type, date filtering
4. **Vector embeddings** - For semantic search across filings

## MVP Priorities (First 4 weeks)

1. **High Priority**: LSM storage + vector search + basic gRPC API
2. **Medium Priority**: Single-node optimization + document schema
3. **Low Priority**: Web dashboard + monitoring (can use external tools initially)

This gets you to a working single-node vector database suitable for development and testing.
