//! # Query Facade Adapter Integration Tests
//!
//! This module contains integration tests for the `QueryFacadeAdapter` and
//! `UnifiedQueryFacade` that validate the unified query routing architecture.
//!
//! ## Test Organization
//!
//! - `test_vector_through_facade.rs`: Vector search routing tests
//! - `test_sql_through_facade.rs`: SQL query routing tests
//! - `test_graph_through_facade.rs`: Graph query routing tests
//! - `test_rest_grpc_parity.rs`: REST/gRPC parity tests (feature: unified-facade-routing)
//! - `test_explain_plan_consistency.rs`: Explain plan format consistency tests
//!
//! ## Feature Flag
//!
//! These tests validate the `unified-facade-routing` feature flag behavior.
//! When enabled, all queries route through `UnifiedQueryFacade` for consistent
//! execution. When disabled, legacy direct handler paths are used.
//!
//! ## Architecture Validation
//!
//! ```text
