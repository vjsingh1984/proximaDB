"""Chunking conformance sweep — the TD-CHUNK-1 baseline, landed RED-as-recorded.

This is the specification ADR-091 says the ecosystem never had, made enforceable.
It deliberately does **not** fix anything: TD-CHUNK-1's acceptance is the suite
plus the recorded baseline, and TD-CHUNK-2 onward turns the recorded violations
green.

Why a recorded baseline instead of ``xfail``
--------------------------------------------
The baseline is a **bidirectional ratchet**. Each (strategy, corpus) case asserts
its violation set *exactly*:

* a new violation fails -> regressions are caught;
* a **fixed** violation also fails, until the baseline is updated -> nobody
  repairs a defect without recording that they did, and nobody can quietly let a
  fix rot back.

``xfail(strict=True)`` gives the second property but scatters the state across 60
markers. A single reviewable mapping is the state of truth, and it is generated
from a real sweep (``format_baseline``) rather than hand-asserted — so it records
what the code *does*, not what anyone believes it does. That distinction is the
whole lesson of the audit that produced ADR-091: the pre-existing suite had 426
passing tests and caught none of these defects.

Baseline after the correctness slice: **70 cases, 70 clean, 0 violations,
0 errors** — seven strategies x ten corpus entries — every swept strategy now satisfies every invariant, so BASELINE is
empty and ``VIOLATION_CEILING = 0`` makes the aggregate ratchet an ABSOLUTE
assertion rather than a shrinking allowance. A single new violation anywhere
fails the build.

(Initial recording against develop @482075bc1 was 22 clean / 67 violations.)
(Initial recording against develop @482075bc1 was 22 clean / 67 violations.)

Note on running locally
-----------------------
The repo's conftests rely on the *installed* package. If your editable install
points at a different worktree you will silently test that one, so run this with
``PYTHONPATH=clients/python/src`` to pin the tree under test.
