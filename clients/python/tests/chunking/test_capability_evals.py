"""Eval gates for TD-CHUNK-3 items 4 and 5, and the honest limit of the rubric.

Per the evals mandate, a ranked surface needs a rubric rather than an
assertion. The finding that shapes this file is that the rubric can gate one of
these two capabilities and **structurally cannot gate the other** -- and saying
so is more useful than inventing a proxy that would gate it badly.

``conformance/evals.py`` is deliberately model-independent: every metric scores
what the chunker decided, so a red gate is always attributable to chunking.
That is exactly why it can see small-to-big (which changes which spans are
returned) and cannot see context enrichment (which changes only the text sent
to a model, leaving every span identical). A rubric that could see enrichment
would be a rubric whose failures could not be attributed -- the property the
harness was built to avoid.
