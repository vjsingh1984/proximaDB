"""Schema-level proto/stub drift gate (TD-PROTO-1).

`test_grpc_proto_drift.py` computes missing-stub / missing-servicer / missing-rpc.
All three are about **services and rpcs**, so a `.proto` change that adds a
message, a field or an enum and touches no service moves nothing in that drift
set and the gate is green by construction. `collection_types.proto`, where this
surfaced, declares no service at all — which is why a field sat unreflected in
the checked-in stub indefinitely.

This gate closes that hole by comparing the **serialized `FileDescriptorProto`**
embedded in each committed `*_pb2.py` against one generated from the `.proto` at
HEAD. Byte equality is the whole test:

* it needs no proto parsing, so it cannot drift from the schema language;
* it catches messages, fields, enums, rpcs **and options** together — the
  `deprecated: true` markers a hand-rolled comparison would miss;
* it is immune to protoc's *formatting*, which differs from the committed files
  and would otherwise dominate a textual diff. Of 26 files with a text diff when
  TD-PROTO-1 was measured, **12 had byte-identical descriptors**.

Skipped, not failed, when `grpcio-tools` is unavailable: the generator is a test
dependency and its absence is a missing tool, not drift.
