"""The four post-partition capabilities of TD-CHUNK-3, as :mod:`passes` passes.

Each one is a thin adapter over logic that lives (or now lives) in its own
module, so the capability and its transport into the pipeline stay separable:

============================  =========  ===========================  =========
Pass                          Face       Implementation               Cost
============================  =========  ===========================  =========
:class:`HeadingPathPass`      METADATA   ``boundaries.annotate_...``  free
:class:`DedupPass`            SELECTION  ``dedup.deduplicate``        KEU,KSU v
:class:`ContextEnrichment...` EMBEDDED   here                          KEU ^
:class:`ParentLinkagePass`    RETRIEVED  here                          KSU ^
============================  =========  ===========================  =========

The first two already shipped as boolean flags inlined in
``TextDocumentProcessor.chunk``; they are retrofitted rather than rewritten, so
the retrofit is provably behaviour-neutral against the golden snapshot, and the
two new capabilities land on a seam that already has two working occupants
instead of being its first and only users.

    Small-to-big: embed precise child chunks so retrieval is sharp, then return
    the surrounding parent so generation has room. The child is what matches;
    the parent is what is read.

    **The parent is emitted once and referenced, never copied onto its
    children.** Copying is the obvious implementation and it multiplies KSU by
    the fan-out -- ~4x here -- which is the same cost mistake this program has
    now found in three separate places. Children carry ``parent_id``; the
    parent is a chunk in its own right, marked ``chunk_type="parent"`` so a
    caller can store it without embedding it, and the relationship is emitted
    as a :class:`~.passes.ChunkEdge` for whatever the caller uses to hold edges
    (an ORION edge in the server -- the linkage this database can offer that a
    pure vector store cannot).

    Parents are formed by merging **consecutive** children up to
    ``parent_window`` characters, never across a change of heading path. That
    guarantees the two properties small-to-big actually needs -- a parent
    contains its children's spans exactly, and a parent is itself a span of the
    document -- without a second chunking pass, and it reuses the heading
    metadata rather than re-deriving structure.
