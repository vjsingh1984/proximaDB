"""Down-convert an OpenAPI 3.1 document to 3.0.3 for oapi-codegen (TD-126 Phase 2).

The published ProximaDB spec (docs/openapi/proximadb-openapi.yaml) is generated
from the utoipa-annotated axum handlers as OpenAPI 3.1.0 and is drift-gated by
Phase 1. The Go generator (oapi-codegen v2.4.x / kin-openapi 0.127) does not yet
support OpenAPI 3.1 (https://github.com/oapi-codegen/oapi-codegen/issues/373).

Rather than hand-editing the source spec (forbidden — it is generated + gated),
`make gen-go-sdk` runs this transform on a *temporary copy* immediately before
codegen. The transform is intentionally minimal and mechanical:

  * `openapi: 3.1.x`              -> `openapi: 3.0.3`
  * `type: [T, "null"]`          -> `type: T` + `nullable: true`
  * `type: ["null", T]`          -> `type: T` + `nullable: true`
  * `type: [T]`                  -> `type: T`
  * drop 3.1-only keywords that 3.0 validators reject (`const`, `examples` at
    schema scope is left alone — kin-openapi tolerates it).

This is a build-time adapter, not a spec edit: the source spec is untouched, and
the generated Go client's drift gate regenerates through this same transform, so
the generated artifact stays pinned to the published spec.
